## Details

**Union find** is a data structure that tracks elements split into one or
more disjoint sets. Its two primary functions are `find()` and `union()`.
The `union()` operation merges two groups together.

For example, say we were running a team of engineers on a project. The
engineers are identified by the following integers:

```
1    2    3    4    5
6    7    8    9    10
11   12   13   14
```

Each of these engineers must get together to form subteams, each in charge
of some aspect of the project. So, we group (`union()`) them as follows:

```
[1][2][11]
[3][4][5]
[6][9]
[8][10]
[12][14]
```

Over time, we see that some subteams have completed their work before the
others, so we have those subteams join other teams:

```
[1][2][11]
[3][4][5][6][9][8][10]
[12][14]
```

Union find does all of this very effectively.
