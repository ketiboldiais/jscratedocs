# MaxHeap

The `MaxHeap` module implements a max binary heap. This is effectively a
binary search tree where each parent node's value is smaller than its child
node's value.

## `maxHeap()`

- Instantiates an instance of `MaxHeap`.
- If no arguments are passed, the heap is initially empty.
- Otherwise, comma separated data values (or a spread of an array of data
  values) will be used to populate the heap.

```javascript
const h = maxHeap(41, 39, 33, 18, 27, 12, 55);
h.print();
```

```terminal
[55,39,41,18,27,12,33]
```

## `push(𝑣)`

- Inserts the value 𝑣 into the heap.
- Return: `this`
- Worst Case: ${O(\lg n)}$
- Average Case: ${O(\lg n)}$

```javascript
const h = maxHeap().push(1).push(8).push(6).push(5).push(3).push(9);
h.print();
```

```terminal
[9,5,8,1,3,6]
```

## `insert(v[])`

- Takes an array argument, and pushes each array element into the heap.

```javascript
const h = maxHeap().insert([1, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9]);
h.print();
```

```terminal
[9,5,8,1,3,6]
```

## `delete()`

- Removes the smallest value in the heap.
- Return:
  - If the heap is not empty: The value deleted.
  - If the heap is empty: null.
- Worst case: ${O(\lg n)}$
- Best case: ${O(\lg n)}$

```javascript
const h = maxHeap().insert([1, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9]);
h.print();
h.delete();
h.print();
```

```terminal
[9,5,8,1,3,6]
[8,5,6,1,3]
```

## `max()`

- Returns the largest value in the heap, without mutating the heap.
- If the heap is empty, returns `null`.
- Because the largest value in the heap is always the first element, this
  is a trivial ${O(1)}$ operation.

```javascript
const h = maxHeap().insert([1, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9]);
const m = h.max();
Print(m);
```

```terminal
9 
```

## `min()`

- Returns the largest value in the heap, without mutating the heap.
- Because the a min heap prioritizes the lesser of two values, this
  requires iterating over ${n/2}$ nodes (only the leaf nodes can possibly
  containing a maximum). Accordingly, this has a running time function of
  ${T(n) = n/2,}$ or, in big-O terms, ${O(n).}$

```javascript
const h = maxHeap().insert([1, 8, 6, 5, 3, 9]);
const m = h.min();
Print(m);
```

```terminal
1
```
