| AVL           | AVL tree implementation, following Adelson-Velskii and Landis's 1962 paper _[An Algorithm for the Organization of Information](https://zhjwpku.com/assets/pdf/AED2-10-avl-paper.pdf)._   |
| Graph         | Simple graph; implementation uses adjacency list approach (specifically, a JavaScript `map`).                                                                                            |

| Trie          | Basic trie; uses a tree-like structure where each node is an array. By default, only the ASCII Latin characters are supported, but the alphabet can be extended (at the cost of memory). |
