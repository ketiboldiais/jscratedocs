# Queue

The `Queue` class implements a basic queue. Queues operate on the _FIFO
(first in, first out)_ property.

## Create a New Queue

An instance of `queue` can be created by passing a comma separated list of
values to the `queue` function:

```javascript
const q = queue(5, 6, 7, 8);
```

## `𝑄.length()`

- Returns the current length of the queue.
- Time complexity: ${O(1)}$

## `𝑄.peek()`

- Returns, but does not remove, the current element at the head of the
  queue.
- Time complexity: ${O(1)}$

## `𝑄.enqueue(𝑣)`

- Inserts the data value 𝑣 at the head of the queue.
- Time complexity: ${O(1).}$

## `𝑄.dequeue()`

- Returns, and removes, the current element at the head of the queue.
- Time complexity: ${O(1)}$

## `𝑄.insert(𝑣,𝑖)`

- Inserts the data value 𝑣 at the position 𝑖 in the queue.
- 𝑖 must be in the set:
  - ${\{ i \in \N : i \leq L \}}$
  - where ${L}$ is the length of the queue.
- Time complexity: ${O(n)}$

## `𝑄.contains(𝑣)`

- Returns `true` if the queue contains the value 𝑣, `false` otherwise.
- Time complexity: ${O(n)}$

## `𝑄.clear()`

- Removes all queuers in the queue.
- Time complexity: ${O(1)}$

## `𝑄.isEmpty()`

- Returns `true` if the queue has no queuers, `false` otherwise.

## `𝑄.arrayed()`

- Returns, without removing, the queue's elements as an array.

## Cost-benefit Analysis

| Costs                       | Benefits                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Searching runs on ${O(n).}$ | Insertion runs on ${O(1).}$ |
| Access runs on ${O(n).}$    | Removal runs on ${O(1).}$   |
